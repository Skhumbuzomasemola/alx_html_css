##  Key Features & Interactions

- **Responsive Breakpoint (â‰¤ 480px)**: The design switches to a mobile-friendly layout when the screen width is 480px or less, following mobile-first responsive principles.  
  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Link Hover/Active State**: Links change color to `#FF6565` on hover and when active:
  ```css
  a:hover,
  a:active {
    color: #FF6565;
  }
